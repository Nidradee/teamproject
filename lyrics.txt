Caroline, see she's the reason for the word bitch (BITCH)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash, crash
Into a ditch
Just playing
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah
=======
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
